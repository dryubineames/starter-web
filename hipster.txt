You and I will only live this life once. One day, and we do not know when, it will be over. What will we do today that will make it a life we can look back over and say  I nurtured my life and I loved it? What will we do tomorrow, next week and next month? When we live deliberately to be and evolve into who we truly love to be, do what we love to do, achieve what we love to achieve and make the difference we love to make, then we live a life we love. (When we don't to do those things - well we do not live a life we love). Living a life we love means we we can look back on from our spiritual eternity and say - I lived my life my way. Living a life we love cannot happen by accident. Living a life we love, becoming who we love to be, achieving what we love to achieve and making the difference we love to make requires us to do to manage how we invest our time, energy and attitude. Time, energy and attitude are the currencies of life. A positive, can do attitude along with an effective approach directed toward what we truly desire from life creates and directs our energy toward living the life we love, which in turn means we spend our time being and doing what we love doing.
